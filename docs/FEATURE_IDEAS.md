# Terdex Feature Ideas

1. **Interactive Chat Mode** – Layer a lightweight REPL on top of the planner so
   users can iteratively refine steps, accept or reject actions, and request
   clarifications without re-running the full command.
2. **Playbook Marketplace** – Provide a curated catalog of Termux-ready
   playbooks contributed by the community, installable via a single command.
3. **Workspace Health Checks** – Add a `terdex doctor` command that inspects the
   local environment for missing packages, stale caches, or risky settings and
   produces remediation steps tailored for Termux devices.
